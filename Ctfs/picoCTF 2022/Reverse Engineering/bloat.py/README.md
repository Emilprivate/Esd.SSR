# Writeup for picoCTF-2022 : bloat.py

## Steps:
So this challenge was about trying to understand an obfuscated python script. At the end it was just about commenting out a branching function so we'd be able to skip to the decoding of the flag immidietely. This happened to be the `arg133(arg432)` function.


## Flag:
```picoCTF{d30bfu5c4710n_f7w_161a4f09}```
