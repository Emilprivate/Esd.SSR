# Writeup for picoGym Exclusive : Local Target

## Tools:
- Source code analysis
- Buffer overflow testing
- ASCII value conversion

## Steps:

### 1. Initial Challenge Analysis
The challenge description stated: "Smash the stack Can you overflow the buffer and modify the other local variable? The program is available here. You can view source here."

One of the major advantages of this challenge was that both the binary and source code were provided, eliminating the need for reverse engineering or decompilation. This allowed me to focus directly on understanding the program's logic and identifying the vulnerability.

### 2. Source Code Examination
Upon examining the source code, I identified that the program contains an input buffer with a fixed size of 16 characters. The key insight was recognizing that there's another local variable on the stack that could potentially be overwritten through a buffer overflow attack.

The proper approach would have been to:
- Analyze the stack layout using debugging tools
- Calculate the exact offset from the buffer to the target variable
- Determine the RBP (base pointer) location
- Account for the 64-bit architecture by adding 8 bytes to the RBP offset

However, I decided to take a more experimental approach for this challenge.

### 3. Experimental Buffer Overflow Approach
Instead of performing precise stack analysis, I opted for a trial-and-error methodology to determine the exact overflow requirements. My strategy was:

1. Start by inputting more than the 16-character buffer limit
2. Gradually increase the input length while monitoring the target variable's value
3. Continue until I observed the variable being overwritten to 0
4. Fine-tune the payload to achieve the desired variable value

Through this iterative process, I discovered that inputting exactly 24 characters would cause the target variable to be overwritten with a value of 0.

### 4. Crafting the Final Payload
Once I established that 24 characters would overwrite the target variable to 0, I needed to set it to a specific value. Since I wanted to change the variable to 65 (the ASCII value of 'A'), I crafted my final payload by adding one more character - the letter 'A'.

The final payload consisted of:
```
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
(25 'A' characters total)

This payload successfully:
- Overflows the 16-character input buffer
- Overwrites the target local variable with the value 65 (ASCII 'A')
- Triggers the win condition for the challenge

### 5. Result and Learning
The buffer overflow was successful, and the program executed the desired code path, revealing the flag. This challenge served as an excellent introduction to basic stack-based buffer overflow techniques and demonstrated how local variables can be manipulated through carefully crafted input.

While my approach was more experimental than methodical, it effectively illustrated the fundamental concept of buffer overflows and their impact on adjacent memory locations on the stack.
