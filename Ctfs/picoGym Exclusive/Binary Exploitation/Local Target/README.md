# Writeup for picoGym Exclusive : Local Target
## Task:
Smash the stack Can you overflow the buffer and modify the other local variable? The program is available here. You can view source here. And connect with it using:
## Steps:
In this challenge we're provided with the binary and source code belonging to it, so we don't have to decompile it. The input array has a size of 16 characters. However, instead of doing this the proper way by checking how many bytes in where the buffer hits the RBP and then since this is a 64 bit binary, adding 8 to the RBP offset to get the correct stack offset to overwrite the variable value, I did a guessing game and threw in more than 16 characters until I got the variable to hit 0 then I simply added an `A` which is 65 in ascii to convert the number to 65.

So adding 24 characters followed by an "A" will overwrite the num variable to 65.

`AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`
