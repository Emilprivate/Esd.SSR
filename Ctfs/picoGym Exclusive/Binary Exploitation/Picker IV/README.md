# Writeup for picoGym : Picker IV

## Steps
Running the application we're being told to enter the address of the function we want to execute. So if we just open the binary using gdb, run `info functions` and check what the address for the `win` function is, we could use that to get the flag, which is exactly what I did.

## Flag:
```picoCTF{n3v3r_jump_t0_u53r_5uppl13d_4ddr35535_01672a61}```
