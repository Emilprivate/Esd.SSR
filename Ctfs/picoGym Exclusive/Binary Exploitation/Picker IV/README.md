# Writeup for picoGym Exclusive : Picker IV

## Tools:
- GDB (GNU Debugger)
- Binary analysis
- Function address exploitation

## Steps:

### 1. Initial Program Analysis
When I first executed the application, I was presented with a prompt asking me to enter the address of a function I wanted to execute. This immediately suggested that the program was designed to accept user input in the form of memory addresses and would then jump to or call the specified function.

This type of challenge is a classic example of a function pointer vulnerability, where the program trusts user input to provide valid function addresses without proper validation or restrictions.

### 2. Identifying the Target Function
The challenge structure strongly suggested that there would be a "win" function or similar function that, when called, would reveal the flag. My approach was to use debugging tools to examine the binary's function table and locate any functions that might contain the flag or trigger the win condition.

### 3. Using GDB for Function Discovery
I opened the binary in GDB (GNU Debugger) to perform static analysis and examine the program's structure. The key steps in my debugging process were:

1. **Loading the binary**: Started GDB with the target binary
2. **Examining functions**: Used the `info functions` command to display all available functions in the program
3. **Locating the win function**: Searched through the function list to identify the target function, which was named `win`
4. **Extracting the address**: Noted the memory address where the `win` function was located

The `info functions` command in GDB provided me with a comprehensive list of all functions present in the binary, including their respective memory addresses.

### 4. Exploiting the Vulnerability
Once I had identified the address of the `win` function through GDB analysis, the exploitation process was straightforward:

1. **Launched the program**: Executed the binary normally
2. **Input the function address**: When prompted, I entered the exact memory address of the `win` function that I had discovered using GDB
3. **Triggered execution**: The program accepted my input and jumped to the specified address, executing the `win` function

### 5. Success and Flag Retrieval
The program successfully executed the `win` function, which contained the logic to display the flag. This demonstrated a clear case of insufficient input validation, where the program blindly trusted user-provided memory addresses without implementing proper security checks.

This challenge effectively illustrated the dangers of allowing user-controlled function pointers and the importance of input validation in security-critical applications.
