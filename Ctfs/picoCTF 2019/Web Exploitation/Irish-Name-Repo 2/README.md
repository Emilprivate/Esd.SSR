# Writeup for picoCTF 2019 : Irish-Name-Repo 2
## Steps:
The hint mentioned the password being filtered, but it said nothing about the username. So if we attempt another sql injection on the username we get:
`admin'--`
`Your flag is: picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_fa983901}`
## Flag:
``` picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_fa983901} ```
