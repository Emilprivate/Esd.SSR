# Writeup for picoCTF 2019 : Irish-Name-Repo 2

## Tools:
- Web browser
- SQL injection techniques
- Input field analysis
- Authentication bypass methods

## Steps:

### 1. Initial Challenge Analysis
This challenge represents the second installment in the "Irish-Name-Repo" series, building upon the SQL injection concepts introduced in the first challenge. The title suggests that this challenge would require more advanced SQL injection techniques or a different approach to bypass the authentication system.

The challenge presented me with a web application that likely had enhanced security measures compared to its predecessor, requiring me to think creatively about alternative attack vectors.

### 2. Understanding the Security Improvements
When I first examined the application, I noticed that it appeared to have implemented some form of input filtering or validation. This indicated that the developers had learned from the vulnerabilities in the first version and attempted to secure the application against common SQL injection attacks.

The challenge hint provided crucial information: it mentioned that "the password being filtered," which immediately told me that:
- The application was implementing some form of input sanitization on the password field
- Direct SQL injection attempts on the password field would likely be blocked or filtered
- I needed to look for alternative injection points

### 3. Analyzing Input Field Vulnerabilities
With the knowledge that password filtering was in place, I began systematically analyzing other input fields in the application. The hint was particularly valuable because it specifically mentioned that the password was filtered "but it said nothing about the username."

This observation led me to focus my attention on the username field as a potential injection point. The developers had apparently secured one field while leaving another vulnerable - a common oversight in web application security.

### 4. Developing the SQL Injection Strategy
Understanding that the username field was likely unprotected, I developed a SQL injection strategy targeting this input field. My approach was to use a classic SQL injection technique that would:

- Comment out the rest of the SQL query to bypass password validation
- Potentially authenticate as an administrative user
- Reveal the flag through successful authentication bypass

### 5. Crafting the SQL Injection Payload
I constructed a SQL injection payload specifically designed for the username field:

```
admin'--
```

This payload works by:
- `admin` - attempting to authenticate as an administrative user
- `'` - closing the string parameter in the SQL query
- `--` - commenting out the remainder of the SQL query, including password validation

The double dash (`--`) is a SQL comment syntax that effectively removes any password checking logic from the query.

### 6. Executing the Authentication Bypass
When I submitted the crafted payload in the username field (leaving the password field empty or with any value), the SQL injection was successful. The application processed the malformed query and bypassed the authentication mechanism entirely.

The SQL query likely became something like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'-- AND password='...'
```

The commented portion meant the password check was ignored, allowing me to authenticate as the admin user.

### 7. Flag Retrieval and Verification
Upon successful authentication bypass, the application immediately displayed the flag:

```
Your flag is: picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_fa983901}
```

This confirmed that my SQL injection approach was successful and that I had correctly identified the vulnerable input field.

### 8. Learning Outcomes
This challenge effectively demonstrated several important web security concepts:

- **Inconsistent input validation**: How developers sometimes secure one field while leaving others vulnerable
- **Alternative injection points**: The importance of testing all input fields, not just obvious targets
- **SQL comment injection**: Using comment syntax to bypass authentication logic
- **Defense evasion**: How attackers adapt when some security measures are implemented

The challenge highlighted that partial security implementations can be just as dangerous as no security at all, as they may give developers a false sense of security while leaving exploitable vulnerabilities.

## Flag:
```picoCTF{m0R3_SQL_plz_fa983901}```
