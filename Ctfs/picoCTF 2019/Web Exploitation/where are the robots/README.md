# Writeup for picoCTF 2019 : where are the robots

## Tools:
- Web browser
- URL manipulation
- robots.txt analysis
- Web reconnaissance techniques

## Steps:

### 1. Initial Challenge Analysis
This challenge presented me with a web application that I needed to explore to find the hidden flag. The challenge title "where are the robots" immediately provided a significant hint about the solution approach, suggesting that I should investigate robot-related files or directories.

The title effectively telegraphed that the solution would involve understanding how web crawlers and search engine robots interact with websites, particularly through standardized files that control their behavior.

### 2. Understanding the Robots.txt Concept
The challenge title strongly hinted at the `robots.txt` file, which is a standard used by websites to communicate with web crawlers and search engine bots. This file serves several important purposes:

- **Crawler guidance**: Instructs search engine bots which parts of a website they should or shouldn't access
- **Directory listing**: Often reveals the structure of website directories and paths
- **Hidden content discovery**: Sometimes inadvertently exposes sensitive or hidden areas of a website
- **Security implications**: Can reveal information that website administrators intended to keep private

### 3. Accessing the Robots.txt File
Based on the challenge hint, I navigated to the standard location where robots.txt files are hosted:

```
http://[website-url]/robots.txt
```

The robots.txt file is conventionally placed in the root directory of a website and follows a standardized format that web crawlers recognize and respect. By accessing this file, I could examine what restrictions or guidance the website provided to automated crawlers.

### 4. Analyzing the Robots.txt Contents
Upon accessing the robots.txt file, I discovered that it contained references to specific URL paths or directories. The file revealed additional paths that were either:

- Disallowed for crawler access (indicating potentially sensitive content)
- Listed as specific directories that contained important information
- Referenced as locations that the website administrator wanted to control access to

This discovery provided me with a new URL path that wasn't immediately obvious from the main website interface.

### 5. Following the Discovered Path
Using the URL path information obtained from the robots.txt file, I navigated to the newly discovered location:

```
http://[website-url]/[discovered-path]
```

This approach of following breadcrumbs from the robots.txt file is a common web reconnaissance technique, as website administrators sometimes unintentionally reveal sensitive directories or files through their crawler restriction policies.

### 6. Flag Discovery and Retrieval
When I accessed the URL path discovered through the robots.txt analysis, I found a page that contained the flag. The flag was displayed on this previously hidden or restricted page, confirming that the robots.txt file had successfully led me to the correct location.

### 7. Learning Outcomes
This challenge effectively demonstrated several important web security and reconnaissance concepts:

- **Information disclosure through robots.txt**: How standard web files can inadvertently reveal sensitive information
- **Web reconnaissance techniques**: Using publicly available files to discover hidden content
- **Security through obscurity failures**: Why hiding content through robots.txt restrictions is insufficient security
- **Crawler behavior understanding**: How search engines and web crawlers interact with websites

The challenge highlighted that robots.txt files, while useful for legitimate crawler management, can also serve as reconnaissance tools for security researchers and attackers seeking to understand website structure.
