# Writeup for picoCTF 2019 : insp3ct0r

## Tools:
- Web browser with developer tools
- HTML source code inspection
- CSS file examination
- JavaScript file analysis

## Steps:

### 1. Initial Challenge Analysis
This challenge presented me with a web application that I needed to investigate to find the hidden flag. The challenge title "insp3ct0r" immediately provided a strong hint about the solution approach, suggesting that I should use web browser inspection tools to examine the website's source code and related files.

The title effectively indicated that the solution would involve thorough inspection of the web application's client-side components.

### 2. Understanding Web Inspector Tools
The challenge hint pointed me toward using browser developer tools, which provide comprehensive access to a website's client-side resources. Modern web browsers offer inspection capabilities that allow examination of:

- HTML source code and structure
- CSS stylesheets and formatting rules
- JavaScript files and client-side logic
- Network requests and responses
- Various other web resources

### 3. HTML Source Code Inspection
I began my investigation by examining the HTML source code of the webpage. This is typically the first step in web application reconnaissance, as HTML often contains comments, metadata, or hidden elements that might reveal sensitive information.

When I inspected the HTML source code, I discovered the first part of the flag:
```
picoCTF{tru3_d3
```

This discovery confirmed that the flag was distributed across multiple files, and I needed to continue searching through other web resources to find the complete flag.

### 4. CSS Stylesheet Analysis
With the first portion of the flag found in the HTML, I proceeded to examine the CSS files associated with the webpage. CSS files can sometimes contain comments or data that web developers might not expect users to inspect closely.

Upon examining the CSS file, I found the second portion of the flag:
```
t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t
```

This discovery reinforced the pattern that the flag was intentionally split across different types of web files, requiring systematic inspection of each component.

### 5. JavaScript File Investigation
Having found flag portions in both HTML and CSS files, I logically proceeded to examine any JavaScript files associated with the webpage. JavaScript files are another common location where developers might embed information, either intentionally or accidentally.

My investigation of the JavaScript file revealed the final portion of the flag:
```
_lucky?2e7b23e3}
```

### 6. Flag Reconstruction and Verification
With all three portions of the flag discovered across the different file types, I needed to reconstruct the complete flag by concatenating the pieces in the correct order:

- **HTML portion**: `picoCTF{tru3_d3`
- **CSS portion**: `t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t`
- **JavaScript portion**: `_lucky?2e7b23e3}`

Combining these in sequence produced the complete flag:
```
picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?2e7b23e3}
```

### 7. Learning Outcomes
This challenge effectively demonstrated several important web security and reconnaissance concepts:

- **Client-side information disclosure**: How sensitive information can be inadvertently exposed in client-side files
- **Multi-source investigation**: The importance of examining all available web resources during reconnaissance
- **Developer tool proficiency**: Practical skills for using browser inspection tools effectively
- **Systematic approach**: The value of methodically checking different types of web files

The challenge highlighted that information can be distributed across multiple client-side resources and emphasized the importance of comprehensive web application inspection.
