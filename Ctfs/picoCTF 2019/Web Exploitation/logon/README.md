# Writeup for picoCTF 2019 : logon
## Steps:
If we open the website and try to login we can see that any user besides "Joe" can login without a password check. If we open the developer tools and check the cookies after logging in with an arbitrary username, we can see there's an "admin" cookie. Set its value to true and refresh the website
