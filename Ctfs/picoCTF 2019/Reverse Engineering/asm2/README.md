# Writeup for picoCTF 2019 : asm2

## Tools:
- Assembly code analysis
- Python programming
- Mathematical calculation
- Control flow tracing

## Steps:

### 1. Initial Challenge Analysis
This challenge presented me with an assembly code snippet that I needed to analyze to determine what value would be returned given specific input parameters. Building upon the concepts from the first asm challenge, this one likely involved more complex logic, loops, or conditional statements that required systematic analysis.

The challenge required understanding assembly language syntax, control flow structures, and potentially iterative operations that needed to be traced through carefully.

### 2. Examining the Assembly Structure
Upon analyzing the provided assembly code, I identified several key components that suggested this challenge was more complex than simple arithmetic operations:

- Multiple registers being used for different purposes
- Conditional jump instructions indicating branching logic
- Loop structures or iterative operations
- More sophisticated control flow patterns

The complexity of the assembly code indicated that manual calculation might be error-prone, making a programmatic approach more reliable.

### 3. Understanding the Input Parameters
The challenge provided specific input values that needed to be traced through the assembly code. These parameters served as the starting conditions for analyzing the program's execution flow and determining the final result.

Understanding how these input values were used in the assembly instructions was crucial for accurately modeling the program's behavior.

### 4. Tracing the Execution Flow
Rather than attempting to manually trace through each assembly instruction, I recognized that the complexity of the code warranted a more systematic approach. The assembly contained multiple branching paths and potentially iterative operations that would be difficult to track manually without making errors.

### 5. Developing a Python Solution
To ensure accuracy and handle the complexity of the assembly logic, I created a Python script that could simulate the assembly code's behavior. This approach offered several advantages:

- **Accuracy**: Reduced the risk of manual calculation errors
- **Verification**: Allowed me to test different scenarios and verify results
- **Efficiency**: Automated the complex calculations and iterations
- **Debugging**: Made it easier to trace through the logic step by step

The Python script translated the assembly operations into equivalent Python code, maintaining the same logical flow and operations while making them more readable and verifiable.

### 6. Implementing the Assembly Logic
My Python script systematically implemented each aspect of the assembly code:

- Variable initialization matching the input parameters
- Conditional statements corresponding to the assembly jump instructions
- Loop structures that mirrored the assembly's iterative behavior
- Arithmetic operations that replicated the assembly calculations

### 7. Executing and Verifying the Solution
When I ran the Python script with the provided input parameters, it calculated the final result through the same logical steps that the assembly code would follow. The script produced the hexadecimal value `0xf6` as the final result.

### 8. Learning Outcomes
This challenge effectively demonstrated several important assembly analysis concepts:

- **Complex control flow**: Understanding how assembly implements loops and conditional statements
- **Programmatic analysis**: Using high-level languages to model assembly behavior
- **Verification techniques**: Employing automated tools to reduce manual calculation errors
- **Problem-solving approaches**: Choosing appropriate methods based on complexity

The use of Python to simulate assembly behavior proved to be an effective technique for handling more complex reverse engineering challenges.
